# java-android-cru-garage-door-not-encrypted 

This program supplies the user interface to the [project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IFt62EF3NbSOA1Vvz_oraNpHULJRAejd/view?usp=sharing) that I carried out between 2012 - 2014 on a universal wireless remote control that learns the encoding of the digital signal of the remote controls that are used for garages or parking gates, but that do not have any type of encryption.

It is possible that I will continue it in this repository or leave it as an archive or continue it in another repository for possible improvements or updates.

To get the android-support-v4.jar library. In this post on stackoverflow.com, they indicate how to get it:
